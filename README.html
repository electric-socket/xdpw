    </h1>
    <p>This is the documentation for the release of version 0.15 of the XDPascal
      compiler (December 31, 2020, code name "New Years Eve"), written by the
      current maintainer, Paul Robinson. The project home is <a href="https://XDPascal.com">https://XDPascal.com</a>,
      it can be downloaded from there, from <a href="https://github.com/electric-socket/xdpw">Github</a>,
      or from <a href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/xd-pascal-compiler/files/latest/download">Sourceforge</a>,
      and bugs can be reported at <a href="https://bugs.xdpascal.com">https://bugs.xdpascal.com</a>,
      (currently using <a href="https://www.mantisbt.org/">Mantis</a>; I may
      switch to <a href="https://www.bugzilla.org/">Bugzilla</a>) or by e-mail
      to <a href="mailto:XDPascal@xdpascal.com">XDPascal@xdpascal.com</a>.
      XDPascal is a 32-bit one-pass self-hosting Pascal compiler for Windows on
      X86 processors. It is open source, written in Pascal (it is used to
      compile itself), and licensed under the BSD-2 clause license. There have
      been a number of major improvements from version 0.14.1. I didn't get to
      everything I had planned to accomplish (who does?) as I set an aggressive
      schedule to complete the compiler by December 31, 2020 and met it. (I have
      found if you don't set a schedule and stick to it, development goes on
      forever, or until the resources run out.) The most important things I
      planned to do did get accomplished. Here are some of the new features: </p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Include files</strong>. Using the <code>$I filename</code> or
        <code>$INCLUDE filename</code> directive, the contents of a file can be
        included at that point in the program, as if the entire file had been
        inserted in place of the comment. To prevent "<i>crock recursion</i>" (a
        file directly or indirectly including itself, causing an endless loop)
        only one <code>$INCLUDE </code>file at a time may be invoked.</li>
      <li>You can create <strong>compile-time definitons</strong>. The compiler
        supports the compiler directives <code>$DEFINE</code> and <code>$UNDEF</code>
        to create and erase compile-time symbols. Symbols can be defined,
        defined as a number value, or defined as having a string value. While
        this&nbsp; feature is nice, it serves no purpose if you can't use it to
        cause the compiler to <i>do</i> something, which brings us to... </li>
      <li><strong>Conditional compilation</strong>: by use of the<code> $IFDEF</code>
        and <code>$IFNDEF</code> directives, to test whether a compile-time
        variable is or is not defined.&nbsp; If the test succeeds, the compiler
        continues scanning and compiling the source. If the test fails, the
        compiler skips over the code in the unit or program until a <code>$ELSE</code>
        or <code>$ENDIF</code> directive is found. You can compile code for
        some conditions and not others through <code>$IFDEF</code> which checks
        to see if a particular compile-time variable is defined, or <code>$IFNDEF
          </code>to check if it is not defined. (I didn't have enough time to
        get <code>$IF</code> and <code>$ELSEIF</code> implemented, but that
        will probably get done in a later release.)</li>
      <li><strong>Conditional identifiers</strong>. The conditional identifier <code>XDP</code>
        is automatically included by the compiler, so it is possible to test
        which compiler a program is being targeted for. I'm thinking, if
        anything in the XDPascal compiler is not compatible with Free Pascal or
        Gnu Pascal (giving someone a choice of which compiler to use) a
        programmer can put <code>{$IFDEF xdp} </code>or<code> (*$IFDEF xdp*)</code>
        before code specifically to be compiled by XDPascal, as well as <code>$IFNDEF
          xdp</code> for code for a different compiler. Or an <code>$IFDEF</code>
        with a different compiler's symbol and <code>$ELSE</code> for portions
        to compile with XDPascal or any other compiler. </li>
      <li><strong>Additional conditional identifiers</strong> used to identify
        the compiler are also defined:</li>
      <ul>
        <li><code>XDP_FULLVERSION</code> which has the value <code>150</code>
          (for version 0.15, the .0 is implied)</li>
        <li><code>XDP_VERSION</code>&nbsp; which is defined as <code>0</code> </li>
        <li><code>XDP_RELEASE</code> which is defined as <code>15</code>; and</li>
        <li><code>XDP_PATCH</code> which is defined as <code>0</code>. </li>
        <li>These definitions were intended to allow checking the compiler
          version for when new features get added, but when I could not finish <code>$IF</code>
          and <code>$ELSEIF</code> in time, they became features to be used
          later.</li>
      </ul>
      <li><strong><code>$NOTE</code> and <code>$WARNING</code></strong> can
        send messages at compile time. They have no effect on the compilation.</li>
      <strong> </strong>
      <li><strong><code>$FATAL </code>and <code>$STOP</code></strong>
        directives immediately halt compilation with an optional message.
        Together with <code>$IFDEF</code>/<code>$IFNDEF</code>/<code>$ELSE</code>
        they can stop a compile of a program if a feature is not present.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3> <span style="color: #3366ff;">The following lesser things also got
        done:</span></h3>
    <h2> </h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Some recovery from user program errors.</strong> While most of
        the compiler is still "quit on error," there has been an improvement so
        that some errors simply produce an error message but the compiler
        continues processing the source program to try and spot more potential
        errors. The compiler originally quit on <em>all </em>errors, so if
        there were any it never reached the linker, which creates the
        executable. As a result if the program finished compiling it always
        called the linker to bind the user's program. Now, the linker will only
        be called if the error count is zero. This means there is the potential
        for the compiler to be able to scan an entire program and report all
        further syntax errors, if any.</li>
      <li><strong>Additional comment type (*.</strong> As was announced in the
        previous release, the compiler supports <code>(* *)</code> as well as <code>{
          }</code> block comments. Diverting from Standard Pascal, comments <u>do
          not</u> nest. e.g. a <code>{ comment }</code> may be inside of a <code>(*
          comment *)</code>&nbsp; and vice-versa; and the terminators cannot be
        mixed, i.e. <code>{</code> <em>must</em> be closed by <code>}</code>
        while <code>(*</code> <em>must</em> be closed by <code>*). (*)</code>
        at the start of a comment does not close that comment .</li>
      <li><strong>More Standard Pascal support</strong>. The symbol pair <code>(.</code>
        may be used interchangeably with <code>[ </code>(open bracket) and the
        symbols <code>.)</code> may be used interchangeably with ] (close
        bracket).</li>
      <li><strong>Better reporting of errors</strong>, e.g. if you declare a
        procedure or function in the <code>INTERFACE</code> section of a <code>UNIT</code>
        (or a forward declaration in the main program or the <code>IMPLEMENTATION</code>
        section of a <code>UNIT</code>) and the header of the procedure or
        function declaration (the "signature") does not match the signature of
        the procedure or function when it is defined, the compiler will more
        precisely say why (2 arguments in the declaration but 3 in the
        definition; argument names or types don't match, e.g. defining an
        argument as real but declaring it as integer, etc.)</li>
      <li><strong>More compiler directives</strong>. A<code> (*$</code> or <code>{$&nbsp;</code>
        comment tells the compiler you want to instruct it about something,
        separate from the code it generates based on the instructions in the
        program .&nbsp; There are a number of directives for tracing what the
        compiler does (very useful if you want to modify it), to support
        features, or to learn things.</li>
      <strong> </strong>
      <li><strong>Much more information</strong> about the user program is
        available, including the number of identifiers used, and now number of
        procedures and functions, including how many are local to the program
        and how many are calls to external routines.</li>
      <li><strong>Several "exercise" programs</strong> test compiler
        functionality, such as the <code>$I filename</code>/<code>$INCLUDE
          filename</code> directive and conditional compilation (see below).</li>
      <li><strong>Several error programs</strong> check the compiler's
        processing of error conditions (to try to implement recovery and
        continued syntax checking).</li>
      <li><strong>Ampersand</strong> (<code>&amp;</code>) may be used before an
        identifier if it might be the same as a keyword.</li>
      <li><strong>Optional dereference operator</strong>. Borrowing from the
        "New Stanford Pascal" mainframe Pascal compiler (<a href="https://github.com/StanfordPascal/Pascal">on
          GitHub</a>), the symbol <code>-&gt;</code> may be used
        interchangeably with <code>^</code> for the dereference operator.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2> <span style="color: #3366ff;">Internals </span></h2>
    <p>For those interested in how the compiler works, there are a number of
      features to allow you to "look under the hood" and see what it is doing.
      These are invoked by compiler directives. These include:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><code>$SHOW</code> to cause the compiler to tell what token (symbol)
        it is processing, block structure, variable assignment, code it is
        generating, etc. These should be used sparingly, as they can generate
        voluminous output. But for determining what happens when a particular
        statement or line is scanned or compiled, it can be an invaluable
        resource. </li>
      <li><code>$HIDE</code> allows some or all of the <code>$SHOW</code> flags
        set to be turned off.</li>
      <li>While the directives are shown in upper case and the flags are shown
        in lower case, the <code>$SHOW</code> and <code>$HIDE</code>
        directives, and the flags are not case sensitive.</li>
      <li>Scanning&nbsp; options include, with <code>$SHOW</code> enabling the
        display, and <code>$HIDE</code> suppressing the display, of:</li>
      <li><code>$SHOW keywords</code> to display when a keyword like <code>IF</code>,
        <code>DO</code>. <code>IMPLEMENTATION</code>, <code>ELSE</code>&nbsp;
        etc. is seen.</li>
      <li><code>$SHOW symbols</code> to display when individual symbols, like <code>&lt;</code>,
        <code>:=</code> or ^ are found.</li>
      <li><code>$SHOW block</code> to show when the three major block types: <code>BEGIN</code>
        - <code>END</code>; <code>REPEAT</code> - <code>UNTIL</code>; and the
        <code>ELSE</code> - <code>END</code> clause in a <code>CASE</code>
        statement, are found.</li>
      <li><code>$SHOW identifiers</code> to show when they are defined or used.</li>
      <li><code>$SHOW procedure</code>, <code>$SHOW function</code> to display
        when a procedure or function signature is spotted, or <code>$SHOW
          procfunc </code>(or<code> </code><code><code>$SHOW procfunc</code></code>)<code>&nbsp;</code>
        to show both</li>
      <li><code>$SHOW limit n</code> causes the compilei to show processing
        output for only the next <code>n</code> items before stopping. </li>
      <li><code>$HIDE limit n</code> stops showing the next n symbols before
        continuing.</li>
      <li><code>$SHOW token</code> turns all of these on (except <code>$SHOW</code>/<code>$HIDE
          limit</code>..) Can produce huge amounts of information, be
        forewarned.</li>
      <li><code>$SHOW code</code> to display what assembly statements and data
        are being generated.</li>
      <li><code>$SHOW codegen</code> to display what procedures or functions are
        being called to generate the code..</li>
      <li><code>$SHOW all</code> and <code>$HIDE all </code>display or stop
        displaying everything listed above.</li>
      <li><code>$SHOW narrow</code> to display one token per screen line.
        Otherwise symbols are shown one after another until the source line
        ends. </li>
      <li><code>$SHOW wide</code> reverses <code>$SHOW narrow.</code></li>
      <li>While a large part of these have been implemented, not everything is
        completely handled; the most important part was to get some conditional
        compilation features <code>$IFDEF</code>, <code>$IFNDEF</code>, <code>$DEFINE</code>
        and <code>$UNDEF</code> and the <code>$INCLUDE</code> feature working.
        But, these were helpful in allowing me to find where to make other
        fixes.</li>
      <li>Lots more comments, suggestions and hints have been added to the
        source code to explain what certain things the compiler does or what
        things are happening.</li>
    </ul>

            use a linked list in dynamic memory for the symbol table. This is
            the first compiler I've seen use an array of records to define its
            symbol table instead of a linked list. Potentially the same thing
            applies to the list of types, which the entries in the identifier
            table refer to. </td>

    <p><br>
    </p>
    <p>I will say there is one inadvertant problem the compiler has. One thing:
      I think the parser is "too tightly integrated" into the code generator. If
      someone uses a FOR statement, the parser should simply tell the code
      generator, "prepare to handle a <code>FOR</code> statement" (or <code>REPEAT</code>,
      or start of a <code>PROCEDURE</code>), then "start <code>FOR</code>
      loop, use this control variable, start with this value, end with this
      value" and let the code generator handle it. Then at the end, tell the
      code generator "End of <code>FOR</code> loop," "end of <code>WHILE</code>
      statement," "<code>ELSE</code> clause in <code>IF</code> statement,"
      etc., and let the code generator handle it. The parser does not need to
      know that the program must push four registers on the stack, or clear the
      EAX register, that's the code generator's job. From a standpoint of making
      the compiler portable for other processors or other operating systems, or
      both, that is the way it should be done. But XDPascal wasn't really
      designed for portability, which is why the "leakage" of information from
      the Code Generator to the Parser is inadvertant. This is probably one
      thing that needs to change. I've seen it in other compilers, especially
      ones like the subset Pascal-S, or the Standard Pascal P5 compiler, where
      the generation of P-code (a forerunner of the Java Virtual Machine
      bytecode) is tied to the scanning and parsing of the program. If these are
      not segregated, the compiler becomes "too tightly bound" and making
      changes&nbsp; or improvements can be very difficult. But I think making
      the compiler capable of being machine independence, and thus portability
      to other architectures, operating systems, or even operating modes (like
      having the compiler generate a different language instead of machine code,
      such as a Pascal to C translator) becomes possible. </p>
    <p>I&nbsp; think having a compiler be "modular" and separating the pieces is
      a good idea; that way if you want to switch how source is scanned, or how
      code is generated, as long as the interface - the procedure calls to
      perform actions - is the same, any piece can be replaced with another,
      possibly better one. Or one to use a different method. For example, the
      program reads the source file by opening it, determining its size,
      requesting a block of memory big enough to hold it, then simply "reading"
      the file by moving a byte from memory. This is obviously much faster than
      doing an operating system request to read one bite. If the compiler is
      moved to a system where files are read a record ata time (like mainframes,
      or if source was being retrieved from a database or an archive) then it
      may be necessary to change how files are accessed, possibly to doing
      multiple reads one after another or reading the whole file as a block and
      using reference counting to know where line endings are. (Knowing line
      endings is important for two reasons:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>To know when a // comment ends, and</li>
      <li>To know if a quoted string was not closed by the end of a line.</li>

    <p>So, I guess that is one of the things I can put down for the future, to
      make the compiler as modular as I can so each "subsystem" can be upgraded,
      or replaced, without affecting any other subsystem that depends upon
      it.&nbsp; We'll see what happens. </p>
    <p>I'm going to take a break from working on XDPascal for a wile to work on
      something I think is desperately needed, especially since Pascal compilers
      either stopped providing it or never did: a cross-reference and listing
      program. There have been many cross-reference programs written before, but
      they were written before UCSD Pascal and later the Object Pascal standard
      gave us units, and include files. A listing program allows you to print
      out your program (and now, it could also generate an HTML or a PDF
      listing), but a cross-reference is a critical tool in understanding how
      your (or someone else's) program works. It can allow you to identify
      unused variables, constants, types or procedures and functions. It can
      also identify what functions or procedures call, or are called by, whom.
      And the same thing for units. If you have an identifier in one unit being
      used in a different one (or where in the other unit it is being used), the
      cross-reference can tell you. Also, one thing this can do, which I saw
      with the LUA compiler documentation, is to create "clickable links" where
      a variable is referenced in an HTML file, clicking on the variable can
      have it jump to the definition in the same or a different file. Extremely
      useful when trying to figure out what a particular part of an application
      is doing, or to spot unintended side effects. While for a smaller program
      like the compiler, it would be nice,&nbsp; when you get to something like
      the Free Pascal compiler, which is potentially hundreds of files and
      dozens of units, it is probably critical to have. And having finished this
      work on XDPascal, a good cross-reference tool is something I think we need
      much more than another Pascal compiler. (Plus it has the added benefit
      that if I create a separate cross-reference program, I don't have to add
      the feature to the compiler. It also then becomes available for other
      programs that use features XDPascal does not support, like objects,
      operator overloading, virtual methods, etc.)</p>
    <p>I also have another program (completely unrelated to Pascal) that I want
      to release in time for a contest in June 2021. So I'm going to be busy,
      but I intend to come back to XDPascal before too long, and add
      improvements. While it may have been Vasily's baby, it's my child now, and
      I want to see what I can help it grow up to become.</p>
    <p>I hope you enjoy this new release as much as I enjoyed creating it. I do
      want to thank Vasiliy Tereshkov who created the previous releases through
      0.12 and made this whole thing possible. (Although I might have simply
      started with something else, it might not have been as good.) </p>
