#XDPW - XD Pascal for Windows: A 32-bit compiler

New feature for version 0.14.0

    Error position: When there is an error, the compiler will report Line number and Column in the file, not just line number

New features for version 0.14.1

More statistics:

-  For each unit, the number of lines compiled for that unit is reported
-  Total number of lines compiled is reported
-     Total number of identifiers (Procedure, Function, Const, and Var) used
-     Highest number of identifiers used
-     Total compilation time and total lines compiled per second
-     Date and time compilation began and ended reported
-     Memory usage for code and data reported in decimal and hex
-  Character misuse is flagged: 
- Close brace } used without a preceding { will warn a person of an incorrect comment
- Using double quote “ is flagged, warning that only \' is allowed
- When an illegal character is discovered, its position and character value are reporteI

I see XDPW as a teaching (“pedagogical”) and convenience tool, for either doing quick compiles either where using a monolithic, large compiler won't do, or for those
looking for an easy, approachable tool for learning to program. I have plans for the
future of XDPW (in no particular order) including: 
-     Change compiler internals to use a linked list for identifiers instead of an array. This will (vastly) increase the size of a program XDPW can compile. It will also demonstrate how to work with linked lists
-  Support (* *) comments
-  Add the NAME qualifier for external routines that might be in characters not 
legal for use as Pascal identifiers
-  Allow insertion of assembly instructions in procedures or blocks
-  More compiler directives including support for listing and cross-reference of variables
-   When warning about unused variables, it reports where they were declared, 
rather than listing them as being at the end of the main program.
-  Start putting in “hooks” to support 64-bit compiling
-   Add support for 64-bit integers and 64-bit arithmetic as well as automatic type
conversion between byte, word and integer values to and from 64-bit values
-   Add the placing of file parameters on the PROGRAM statement, so files can 
be declared
-   Add compile-time conditional compilation
-   Optionally generate assembly language files instead of direct executable programs,
or allow for creating dynamic load libraries (DLLs)
-   Add an “absolute” qualifier for variables accessing internal addresses directly. This is important for certain system programs or hardware access applications
-   Insert support for “C-style” assignment operators: +=, -=, *=, and /=
-  A rudimentary text editor for quick source code fixes
-  Add the & prefix to allow an identifier to be the same as a reserved word
-  Implement the ability to “compile to memory” so a program can be compiled and
run inside the compiler similar to the original Turbo Pascal compiler
-   Separating the code generated from the compiler so it could be used to develop 
for other machines or other operasting systems

I don;t know how much of this I can actually accomplih, but I have to set (reasonable) goals.

I do not expect XDPW to be the “ultimate” go to tool for writing large applications. GNU Pascal and especially Free Pascal do a tremendoius job; in fact, I use the Lazarus editor (nominally used for creating forms-based Free Pascal applications) for working on XDPW. But sometimes Free Pascal is just too slow and bloated for quick edit-compile cycles

What XDPW does well is quick development of small to medium sized programs 
or for “toolbox” work: when you need a quick, simple program to automate a 
task or to figure out how to do something. Or specifically how to write a compiler.
Compilers do a lot of complex work analyzing files and records, and is something 
worth exploring. XDPW is not a“toy,”you can use it to do actual, real work, in a
format that is much more accessable and “approachable” than other monolithic
compilers like GNU Pascal, Delphi or Free Pascal. It's also very efficient. Code 
generated by XDPW can be 90% smaller, programs developed by it can use 
1/10 the space of a similar text-mode application compiled by a full-size compiler.

I mean, the Free Pascal compile is a world-class, full-service compiler capable of 
taking on even extremely large programs. I happen to like it. But I can never 
understand what it is doing; the compiler source code alone is over 250,000 
lines! Plus hundreds to thousands more for each specific CPU it targets. Add to 
that tens of thousands more lines of code for the run-time libraries and it's too 
big for one person to get their head around. At under 15,000 lines, XDPW is very
approachable for one person wanting to learn how a compiler works.

### Features
* [Go-style methods and interfaces](https://medium.com/@vtereshkov/how-i-implemented-go-style-interfaces-in-my-own-pascal-compiler-a0f8d37cd297?source=friends_link&sk=72a20752cb866c716daac13abc1fab22)

* Support for both console and GUI applications
* No external assembler or linker needed
* Floating-point arithmetic using the x87 FPU
* [Integration](https://github.com/vtereshkov/raylib-xdpw) with the [Raylib](https://www.raylib.com) game development library
* Integration with Geany IDE
* Compiler source for Delphi 6/7, Free Pascal and XD Pascal itself (Delphi 2009+ migration is [straightforward](https://github.com/vtereshkov/xdpw/issues/2#issuecomment-573929657))

## Detailed description

### Usage
Type in the command prompt:
```
xdpw <file.pas>
```
The source file should be specified with its extension (.pas).
 
### Language

XD Pascal is similar to Delphi 6/7 and Free Pascal with the following changes:

#### Enhancements
* The compiler is self-hosting
* The compiler is extremely compact (~10000 lines) and can be easily embedded into larger systems
* Go-style methods and interfaces are supported

#### Differences
* Strings are null-terminated arrays of characters (C style), but indexed from 1 for Pascal compatibility
* The `Text` type is equivalent to `file`. It can be used for both text and untyped files
* Method calls and procedural variable calls require parentheses even for empty parameter lists

#### Limitations
* No classical (C++/Delphi style) object-oriented programming
* No visual components
* Units cannot be compiled separately
* Only peephole optimizations
* `Extended` is equivalent to `Double`
* No `High` and `Low` functions for open arrays. Open array length should be explicitly passed to a subroutine 
* Statement labels cannot be numerical 

#### Formal grammar

### Compiler 
The compiler is based on a recursive descent parser. It directly builds a Windows PE executable without using any external assembler or linker.

#### Directives
* `$APPTYPE` - Set application type. Examples: `{$APPTYPE GUI}`, `{$APPTYPE CONSOLE}`
* `$UNITPATH` - Set additional unit search path. Example: `{$UNITPATH ..\units\}`

#### Optimizations
Some simple peephole optimizations are performed:
* Push/pop elimination
* FPU push/pop elimination
* Local variable loading optimizations
* Array element access optimizations
* Record field access optimizations
* Assignment optimizations
* Comparison optimizations
* Condition testing optimizations

#### Inlined procedures and functions
The following identifiers are implemented as part of the compiler. Their names are not reserved words and can be locally redefined by the user.
```pascal
procedure Inc(var x: Integer);
procedure Dec(var x: Integer);
procedure Read([var F: file;] var x1 {; var xi});
procedure Write([var F: file;] x1[:w[:d]] {; xi[:w[:d]]});
procedure ReadLn([var F: file;] var x1 {; var xi});
procedure WriteLn([var F: file;] x1[:w[:d]] {; xi[:w[:d]]});
procedure New(var P: Pointer);
procedure Dispose(var P: Pointer);
procedure Break;
procedure Continue;
procedure Exit;
procedure Halt[(const error: Integer)];
